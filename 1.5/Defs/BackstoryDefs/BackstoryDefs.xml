        <description>As most people within the Enclave, [PAWN_nameDef] was raised to believe that all beings that dwelt in the wasteland were mutated and genetically inferior. [PAWN_pronoun] however, took these lessons more to heart than others and so [PAWN_pronoun] became a politician in the enclave, to advocate for the “cleansing” of the wasteland so that, one day, the last unmutated humans could reclaim the land that is rightfully theirs and finally rebuild the nation that once was.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was a rank-and-file soldier within the Enclave. Of course, rank-and-file in this case meant [PAWN_pronoun] was an excellently trained fighter, equipped with some of the finest equipment of post-war America and instilled with nothing but scorn and disdain for the average wastelander and all other inhabitants of the wasteland, mutated or not.</description>

        <description>Once an ordinary wastelander [PAWN_nameDef], wandered around until that fateful day when [PAWN_pronoun] walked right into an Enclave patrol. The heavily armed soldiers clad in pitch-black power armour told [PAWN_objective] that the country needed [PAWN_possessive] service. [PAWN_nameDef] had no idea what that meant, but before [PAWN_pronoun] could react, [PAWN_pronoun] was knocked unconscious and dragged away, to serve as a labourer for the Enclave, fulfilling all kinds of menial work for [PAWN_possessive] new masters.</description>

        <description>While the Enclave’s bureaucracy was considerably smaller compared to the one of her old-world pendant, it still needed numerous bureaucrats to tend to the copious amounts of paperwork that accumulated over the years. [PAWN_nameDef] was one of those faceless paper pushers and spent most of [PAWN_possessive] life in cramped offices and dusty conference rooms. While [PAWN_nameDef], was an efficient and competent clerk, [PAWN_pronoun] was rather solitary.</description>

        <description>Nominally, the secret service is still tasked with the protection of the president of the United States. However, most Enclave presidents used them as elite troops, charged with the most pressing matters of national security. [PAWN_nameDef] was part of this elite troop. [PAWN_pronoun] was a perfectly trained killing machine, with a total lack of empathy only concerned with the fulfilment of the president’s orders. Even other Enclave members shuddered at [PAWN_possessive] cold, calculating personality.</description>

        <description>The Enclave was very concerned with the exposure of their members to the almost omnipresent radiation of the wasteland. As such, they were careful what their members consumed. [PAWN_nameDef] was tasked with growing the necessary foodstuffs for the Enclave. While people in the wasteland couldn’t be too picky about what they ate, [PAWN_pronoun] generally preferred to grow corn and other non-mutated crops of the pre-war world, instead of their mutated successors, like tatos.</description>

        <description>The Enclave’s high-tech gear needed a lot of maintenance to remain in pristine condition. [PAWN_nameDef] was an Enclave arsenal specialist. [PAWN_possessive] job was to repair the advanced power armour of the Enclave’s Troopers, as well as their high-tech plasma and laser weapons. There were very few communities in the wasteland that were capable of crafting such marvels of technology and the [PAWN_nameDef] zealously guarded these secrets.</description>

        <description>The Enclave never was a particularly numerous group and was, consequentially often short on staff. [PAWN_nameDef] grew up within the lower ranks of the Enclave and was conscripted into service at a young age. [PAWN_pronoun] worked as an adjutant for an Enclave officer. [PAWN_possessive] supervisor wasn’t a particularly friendly person, but [PAWN_nameDef] learned a lot about the day-to-day duties of a military officer and remembered these lessons well.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] showed great promise while being educated within the Enclave and was subsequently made a lab assistant. There [PAWN_pronoun] learned much about many scientific fields such as chemistry, physics, and biology from some of the brightest, albeit not very ethical minds of the Wasteland.</description>

        <description>Every once in a while, the Enclave would scour the Wasteland in search of new “workers”. While the patrols preferred to abduct adults, they weren’t opposed to capturing children. [PAWN_nameDef] was one of those unfortunate kids. While [PAWN_pronoun] was generally looked down upon most other members of the Enclave, it was possible, although unlikely for [PAWN_objective] to rise up to higher ranks within the organisation.</description>

        <description>The skills of the Enclave’s soldiers was the result of years of strenuous training under the supervision of remorseless drill sergeants. Due to a shortage of able recruits, [PAWN_nameDef] was levied into service as a child and spent most of [PAWN_possessive] youth in barracks and on training fields. This made [PAWN_objective] a great warrior indeed, but left little time for anything else, since the Enclave did not exactly promote creative thinking within the rank and file.</description>
