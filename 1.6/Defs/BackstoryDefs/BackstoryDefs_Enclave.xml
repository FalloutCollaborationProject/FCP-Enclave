        <description>Nominally, the secret service is still tasked with the protection of the president of the United States. However, most Enclave presidents used them as elite troops, charged with the most pressing matters of national security. [PAWN_nameDef] was part of this elite troop. [PAWN_pronoun] was a perfectly trained killing machine, with a total lack of empathy only concerned with the fulfilment of the president’s orders. Even other Enclave members shuddered at [PAWN_possessive] cold, calculating personality.</description>

        <description>The Enclave was very concerned with the exposure of their members to the almost omnipresent radiation of the wasteland. As such, they were careful what their members consumed. [PAWN_nameDef] was tasked with growing the necessary foodstuffs for the Enclave. While people in the wasteland couldn’t be too picky about what they ate, [PAWN_pronoun] generally preferred to grow corn and other non-mutated crops of the pre-war world, instead of their mutated successors, like tatos.</description>

        <description>[PAWN_nameDef] was born into the highest echelons of Enclave society. [PAWN_pronoun] was used to underlings taking care of [PAWN_possessive] every need and whim, while [PAWN_pronoun] trained and studied for a career in the leading positions of the Enclave.</description>

        <description>The skills of the Enclave’s soldiers was the result of years of strenuous training under the supervision of remorseless drill sergeants. Due to a shortage of able recruits, [PAWN_nameDef] was levied into service as a child and spent most of [PAWN_possessive] youth in barracks and on training fields. This made [PAWN_objective] a great warrior indeed, but left little time for anything else, since the Enclave did not exactly promote creative thinking within the rank and file.</description>

        <description>After finishing basic education [PAWN_nameDef] was assigned to serve within the byzantine bureaucracy of the Enclave, which ensured the functionality of the organisation. The institution’s focus on ruthless efficiency made [PAWN_objective] cold and unkind.</description>

        <description>The highly stratified society of the Enclave demanded absolute obedience from its citizenry. As an especially loyal child [PAWN_nameDef] was accepted into the ranks of the Enclave Peacekeeping Force, where [PAWN_pronoun] quickly learned how to ensure peace and order, especially within the conscripted masses of forced labourers, usually by means of a cattle prod.</description>

        <description>The complex machinery the Enclave depended upon needed near constant supervision and maintenance. This meant that skilled engineers were always needed and children with a knack for machinery, such as [PAWN_nameDef] were put into training in their early youth.</description>

        <description>Unusual for a child raised in the Enclave, [PAWN_nameDef] showed compassion and mercy on other creatures, even those deemed lower by fellow Enclave members. These character traits made life within the organisation difficult for [PAWN_objective] and [PAWN_pronoun] distanced [PAWN_objective]self from most others.</description>
